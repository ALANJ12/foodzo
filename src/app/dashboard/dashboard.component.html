    <div class="col"><img src="../../assets/images/SHWRMA.jpg" alt=""><H2>SHAWARMA</H2><P>Shawarma is prepared from thin cuts of seasoned and marinated lamb, mutton, veal, beef, chicken, or turkey. The slices are stacked on a skewer about 60 cm (20 in) high. Pieces of fat may be added to the stack to provide extra juiciness and flavor. A motorized spit slowly turns the stack of meat in front of an electric or gas-fired heating element, continuously roasting the outer layer. Shavings are cut off the rotating stack for serving, customarily with a long flat knife.[1]</P><P>TO ORDER</P><BUtton><a href="https://www.swiggy.com/restaurants/shawarma-spot-technopark-thiruvananthapuram-121341">CLICK HERE</a></BUtton></div>
